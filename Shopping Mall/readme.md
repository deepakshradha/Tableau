## 🧱 SQL Data Warehouse & Analysis 

This project focused on designing and implementing a modern data warehouse using SQL and a Star Schema model. The goal is to consolidate operational data from multiple source systems (ERP and CRM) into an optimized, business-ready format for high-performance analytical queries and reporting.

## 🎯 Objectives

Design a Modern DWH: Implement a scalable data warehouse following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

Build ETL Pipelines: Develop robust SQL scripts to handle data extraction, cleansing, transformation, and loading (ETL).

Model Data for Analytics: Transform source data into a Star Schema model optimized for reporting efficiency.


## 🏗️ Data Architecture: The Medallion Approach

The project utilizes a layered data architecture to ensure data quality, traceability, and consistency before it reaches the end-user.

| Layer                 | Purpose         | Content                              | SQL Activity                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze (Raw)**      | Ingestion       | Raw source data exactly as received  | Initial loading                                |
| **Silver (Cleansed)** | Standardization | Cleaned, validated, structured data  | Deduplication, type fixes, normalization       |
| **Gold (Analytical)** | Business-Ready  | Star Schema: Fact & Dimension tables | Fact creation, dimension loading, aggregations |

## ⭐️ Data Modeling: Star Schema

The Gold Layer is implemented using a Star Schema, which separates transactional data from descriptive data, allowing for fast analytical query performance.

Fact Table (gold.fact_sales)

Contains quantitative measures (sales amount, quantity, cost).

Includes foreign keys linking to the dimension tables.

Dimension Tables (gold.dim_customer, gold.dim_product)

Contain descriptive attributes (customer name, product category, etc).

These are used to filter, group, and segment the data in reports.

## ⚙️ ETL Processes & Key Steps

The project's ETL scripts (/scripts folder) cover the entire data lifecycle:

Schema Setup: Creating the database and schemas for the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

Raw Ingestion: Importing raw ERP and CRM data into the Bronze layer tables.

Data Cleansing: Handling missing values, standardizing data types, and resolving data inconsistencies in the Silver layer.

Dimension Loading: Populating all dimension tables in the Gold layer.

Fact Loading: Creating the final FactSales table by performing lookups and joins across dimension tables.

 ## 📊 Business Insights (Analytical Queries)

This section presents the business analysis layer of the project, executed within the scripts/data-analysis/ directory.
After building the Data Warehouse, these SQL scripts transform the curated tables into actionable business reports, enabling insights for decision-making.

To generate ready-to-use analytical views directly inside the Data Warehouse (Gold Layer), focusing on:

- Customer behavior analysis

- Product performance evaluation

- KPI computation for stakeholders

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end implementation of a modern SQL-based Data Warehouse, following best practices in data modeling, ETL/ELT orchestration, and analytical reporting.
By leveraging the Medallion Architecture and a Star Schema model, the system ensures data quality, reliability, and scalability across all layers—from raw ingestion to business-ready facts and dimensions.

The analytical SQL scripts further extend the value of the warehouse by generating ready-to-use customer and product insights directly in the Gold Layer. These curated views (gold.report_customer and gold.report_product) provide powerful, actionable intelligence for business teams, enabling deeper analysis of customer behavior, product performance, and revenue-driving trends.

Together, the Data Warehouse and analytical views establish a solid foundation for BI tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, enabling organizations to build interactive dashboards, monitor KPIs, and make informed, data-driven decisions with confidence.
